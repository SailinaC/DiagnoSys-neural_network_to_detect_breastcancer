# DiagnoSys : Neural network to predict breast cancer

## Project Overview

**DiagnoSys** is a deep learning project aimed at predicting breast cancer using a neural network implemented in PyTorch. The model leverages a well-known breast cancer dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant. This project demonstrates the application of neural networks in the medical field, offering insights for early diagnosis and treatment options.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implements a fully connected neural network with multiple layers and activation functions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Code for training the model and evaluating its performance using accuracy and other metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tools for assessing the model's effectiveness in predicting breast cancer.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
